# Speak Now ‚Äì A Public Speaking Tool for Emotion and Voice Analysis üó£

## Project Description üìù
**Speak Now** is a web-based public speaking tool designed to help users improve their public speaking skills by providing detailed feedback on their recorded or uploaded presentations. The platform performs a dual analysis on both **facial expressions** and **voice tone**, assessing levels of **nervousness** and **confidence**. The analysis generates comprehensive reports that provide feedback to help users identify their strengths and areas for improvement.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Video Upload and Recording:** Users can upload pre-recorded videos or record their presentations directly on the website.
- **Facial Expression Analysis:** Uses OpenCV and the DeepFace library to detect six key emotions ‚Äî Angry, Sad, Happy, Disgust, Fear, and Neutral ‚Äî to assess confidence and nervousness levels.
- **Voice Analysis:** Analyzes tone and pitch to evaluate nervousness and confidence using pre-trained voice models.
- **Comprehensive Reports:** Combines video and voice analysis to generate a detailed feedback report with visual graphs of emotional patterns.

## Technologies Used ‚öô
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js for UI and interactivity.
- **Backend:**
  - Python with Flask for handling API requests.
  - OpenCV for video processing.
  - DeepFace library for emotion recognition.
  - Pre-trained audio models for voice tone analysis.
- **Other:**
  - Axios for making HTTP requests between frontend and backend.
